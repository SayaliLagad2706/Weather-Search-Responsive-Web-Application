# Weather-Search-Responsive-Web-Application
- The aim of this project is to build a responsive web application for weather search across any city in the US
- An initial page allows a user to enter a city or select his/her current location to fetch the corresponding location's weather details
- A card with weather details is displayed along with the 24 hour details in chart format and weekly details too
- LocalStorage of the browser is used to allow the user to mark different places as favorites for easy access of their temperature details in future
- REST API calls are made to different APIs like Forecast.io, DarkSky API, Twitter API, IP API, Google autocomplete API
- The client server communication takes place with AJAX calls to eliminate the need of page refresh
- Several bootstrap libraries are used for a responsive web application
- The front-end is implemented in Angular 7 and server side is implemented in Node.js
- The application is hosted on AWS elastic beanstalk
- Refer to project_description.pdf for implementation details
